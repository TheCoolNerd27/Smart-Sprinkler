# Smart-Sprinkler

This project was born from the idea “What if we reduce the burden of irrigating crops from farmers?” And thus, we started gathering required components for the project.
We decided on making a smart water sprinkler, using Arduino, time module, soil humidity sensor and Bluetooth module to control it wirelessly.
